Various scripts are included for handling C programs
1. Directory 0x01-variables_if_else_while contains programs for loops
2. The directory 0x02-functions_nested_loops contains programs relating to functions and loops
3. The directory 0x03-debugging
4. More functions nested loops directory
5. Directory 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
6. Directory 0x06-pointers_rrays_strings contains functions of arrays, pointers, and string manipulations
7. Directory 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings contains even more pointers and arrays projects
