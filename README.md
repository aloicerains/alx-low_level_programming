### Low level Programming
This is my introduction to low level programming in C
Various scripts are included for handling C programs
1. Directory 0x01-variables_if_else_while contains programs for loops
2. The directory 0x02-functions_nested_loops contains programs relating to functions and loops
3. The directory 0x03-debugging
4. More functions nested loops directory
5. Directory 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
6. Directory 0x06-pointers_rrays_strings contains functions of arrays, pointers, and string manipulations
7. Directory 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings contains even more pointers and arrays projects
8. Directory 0x08-recursions contains recursive projects
9. Direcotry 0x09-static_libraries contains a static library
10. Directorry 0x0A-argc_argv contains projects entailing arguments to main function
11. 0x0B-malloc_free: Contains projects on memory allocation malloc and free functions
12. 0x0C-more_malloc_free: More projects on the malloc realloc and free
12. 0x0D-preprocessor: Contains projects on C preprocessor and macros
