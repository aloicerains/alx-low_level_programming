### 0x1E-search_algorithms   
===========================      
The project foucusses further on search algorithms. Space complexity is introduced in addition to time complexity.      

#### Concepts    
=============     
The following concepts are introduced:    
* [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)    
* [Space complexity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)    

#### Tasks    
==========     
* [ ] Linear Search algorithm:   
Function returns the first index where `value` is located.    
If value is not present, or array is NULL, return `-1'    

* [ ] Binary Search algorithm:   
Function returns the index of the where the `value` is located     
Assume the `array` will be sorted in ascending order and the `value` won't appear more than once.      
If value is not present in the array or the array is NULL, return `-1`
